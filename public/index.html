	  	<p>Ashley Wang is a 22-year-old young photographer. She loves traveling around the world. In 2012, when she visited an old friend in New York, she found out people might need a professional photographer traveling with them to take pictures for them. She thought it might be a good idea to start a related business. Since she was still in college at that time, she decided to wait.

      In 2016, she gruaduated with a Computer Science degree from University of Illinois. Even though she studies engineering, she is a big fan of fashion design and arts. After her gruadtion, she found a job as a part-time front-end engineer and started VineCharcoal Travel Photo Studio.  

      Though she is busy for most of the times, she loves reading and cooking when she is free.
